# NASA_Images

Hello Workday!

This repo contains my implementation for the Nasa Images app.

-----Libraries Used-----
1. Jetpack Compose - For building UI
2. Junit - For building unit tests
3. Retrofit - For making web requests
4. Moshi - For parsing JSON data from web requests
5. Coroutines - For handling asynchronous operations

-----Architecture Overview-----
The app has 3 main modules: model, repository and ui. Model contains data models for representing our data from the api as well as MainViewModel which is used to drive most of the business logic. Repository contains logic related to making the web request. Ui contains all of the logic for building the ui and displaying data to the user.

-----How to Run-----
The app should run in any recent version of Android Studio. I ran it on Android Studio Chipmunk | 2022.2.1 Patch 2. MinSdk is 21.
